## 5Ô∏è‚É£ Tech Stack

### Front end built using:

- **Plotly Dash** for its interactive and easy to create dashboard 
```
NOTE:
Dash uses React under the hood to render the user interface you see when you load a web page created with Dash. Because React allows you to write your user interface in encapsulated components that manage their own state, it is easy to split up parts of code for Dash too. At the end of this tutorial, you will see that Dash components and React components map one to one!

For now, the important thing to know is that Dash components are mostly simple wrappers around existing React components. This means the entire React ecosystem is potentially usable in a Dash application!
```

- **Flask** is lightweight framework that is integrated with Plotly Dash

#### Back end built using:

- [FAST API](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/)
